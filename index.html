    <h2>Capital city-Reykjavik</h2>
    
   <p>From the mighty glaciers to the rolling waves of the Atlantic Ocean to the steaming geothermal pots, Iceland is a land that, in many ways, is defined by water. 

   What better way to connect to Icelandic culture, than emulating the locals and visiting one of Reykjavik's local pools? 
   
   Thanks to Iceland's renewable energy policies, the use of water in large capacities  (i.e. for swimming pools/saunas) is very cheap, therefore making it a favourite pastime amongst Icelanders. 
   
   That passion results in 18 swimming pools being located in the greater ReykjavÃ­k area alone. 
   
   Some of these pools have both an indoor and an outdoor pool, a sauna and at least one hot tub (some even have as many as 7 or 8). Thankfully, tolshe po have heated water, making them accessible all year round.></p>
